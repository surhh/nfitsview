# How to build under Linux

The original development of nFITSview is done under Linux, so the easiest and the fastest way to build is under Linux.

- just build in Qt Creator. 
- it should be also possible to build using CMake from the command line.

# How to build under Windows

Normally there is no need to build under Windows as the install package is provided. 
Anyway, for building under Windows one would need to download/install/build all the dependencies (boost, zlib, libpng), then fix the
corresponding pathes for the libraries in the CMakeLists.txt file and then build the project using Qt Creator.

The latest version (1.1) of nFITSview for Windows 64-bit to download:
